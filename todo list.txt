@todo's

1. refactor the db structure
	* the _buckets and booktransactions tables are obsolete and can be removed
	* other tables have suggested changes however it might not be a terrible idea to just start from scratch using the db structure
	from the current db as a loose guide. In either case, foreign keys need to be utilized.
	* I'm not opposed to using postgreSQL just for fun but not necessarily rooting for it either :).
2. Install Laravel

3. Build Data Models
4. Implement password hashing similar to what was done on the EventColumn site (phpass) (laravel may have a native way of doing something like this, it just needs to be better than md5).
5. Commence building routes, controllers, views and business models (if necessary).
	* we should use AJAX for all form submissions as generally the page is updated with new data after a form is submitted.
	* all views need to be responsive to accomidate mobile devices (though some views may be excluded on mobile devices)
